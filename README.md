<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>All animations and interactions are expertly managed using GSAP. You can easily modify existing animations or create new ones by editing the <code>script.js</code> file. GSAP's extensive API allows for the creation of various animations, from simple fades to intricate scroll-based effects.</p>

<p>For example, to animate an element with the class of <code>.box</code>, you can include the following code in <code>script.js</code>:</p>

```javascript
var tl = gsap.timeline()
tl.from("nav h1, nav h4, nav button",{
y:-40,
duration:0.5,
delay:0.6,
opacity:0,
stagger:0.15,
})
tl.from(".center1 h1,.center1 p,.center1 button",{
x:-300,
duration:0.4,

})
tl.from(".center2 img",{
